IPv4 and IPv6 Documentation
The Internet Protocol (IP) enables global communication; IPv4 and IPv6 are its versions. This guide explains IPv4 structures, public/private addresses, and IPv6 differences. Based on the transcript, it covers address formats, limitations, and IPv6's expanded capabilities for modern networks.

IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
IPv4 is the foundational IP version, widely used for internet communication.

Structure: 32-bit address (4 bytes or 4 octets); represented in decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.131).
Binary Representation: Each octet is 8 bits (0-255); full address combines 32 bits.
Address Range: 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255; ~4.29 billion unique addresses.
Public IPs: Unique globally; required for internet communication (e.g., 1.1.1.1 to 2.2.2.2).
Limitations: Insufficient for 20+ billion devices; solved via private addresses and NAT (Network Address Translation).

    🌐  Private IPv4 Addresses (RFC 1918)
Private addresses enable internal networks; not routable on the public internet.
Purpose: Used inside private networks; NAT translates to a single public IP for external communication.
Ranges:
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255: ~16 million addresses; ideal for large corporate networks.
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255: ~1 million addresses; for medium networks.
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255: ~65,000 addresses; common for home/small office networks.
Benefits: Conserves public IPs; allows multiple internal devices to share one external IP.


  🌐   IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
IPv6 addresses IPv4's limitations with vastly more addresses and improved structure.
Structure: 128-bit address (16 bytes); represented in hexadecimal with colons (e.g., fe80:0000:0000:0000:5d18:0652:cffd:8f52).
Binary Representation: Each group is 16 bits (2 octets); full 128 bits.
Address Range: 340 undecillion addresses; supports global device growth without NAT reliance.
Benefits: Eliminates address exhaustion; each person can have numerous unique IPs.
Default Subnetting: /64 prefix (first 64 bits for network, last 64 for host); no need for complex subnetting.
DNS Importance: FQDNs essential due to long, hard-to-memorize addresses.
