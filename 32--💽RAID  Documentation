RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) Documentation
RAID combines multiple drives for improved performance, redundancy, or both, protecting against drive failures. This guide covers RAID levels 0, 1, 5, 6, and 1+0 (RAID 10), explaining their mechanics, requirements, benefits, and drawbacks. Based on the transcript, RAID is not a substitute for backups—always maintain separate off-site or external backups.

Overview of RAID
Purpose: Enhances storage reliability and speed; uses multiple drives as a single logical unit.
Implementation: Hardware (RAID controllers/cards) or software (OS-based); requires compatible drives (HDD/SSD).
Key Concepts: Striping (splits data across drives for speed), mirroring (duplicates data for redundancy), parity (error-checking data for recovery).
Trade-offs: Redundancy vs. speed vs. cost; higher redundancy often means more drives and lower usable capacity.

RAID 0 (Striping)
RAID 0 stripes data across drives for maximum speed, with no redundancy.

How It Works: Splits data into blocks and distributes across drives (e.g., file broken into parts on multiple drives).
Minimum Drives: 2.
Pros: Fastest performance; full capacity usable (no overhead).
Cons: No redundancy—if one drive fails, all data is lost.
Use: High-speed tasks like video editing/gaming; not for critical data.

RAID 1 (Mirroring)
RAID 1 mirrors data across drives for redundancy.
How It Works: Duplicates all data on every drive (e.g., Drive 0 and Drive 1 have identical copies).
Minimum Drives: 2.
Pros: Full redundancy; can lose one drive without data loss; simple rebuild.
Cons: 50% capacity overhead (e.g., 2x 1TB drives = 1TB usable); no speed boost.
Use: Critical data (OS, small servers); easy recovery.

RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)
RAID 5 stripes data with distributed parity for single-drive redundancy.

How It Works: Stripes data across drives; one drive holds parity (error-checking data); parity rotates for efficiency.
Minimum Drives: 3.
Pros: Good balance of speed, redundancy, and capacity (e.g., 4 drives = ~75% usable); can lose one drive and rebuild using parity.
Cons: Parity calculation uses CPU; rebuilds slower; not ideal for heavy writes.
Use: General servers, NAS; cost-effective redundancy.

RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)
RAID 6 stripes data with dual parity for double-drive redundancy.
How It Works: Similar to RAID 5 but with two parity drives; can recover from two failures.
Minimum Drives: 4.
Pros: Higher redundancy (lose up to two drives); better for large arrays.
Cons: More CPU overhead; lower usable capacity (e.g., 4 drives = ~50% usable); slower writes.
Use: Large storage systems, data centers; where uptime is critical.

RAID 1+0 (RAID 10, Stripe of Mirrors)
RAID 10 combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping) for speed and redundancy.
How It Works: Stripes data across mirrored pairs (e.g., mirror two drives, then stripe across pairs); requires even number of drives.
Minimum Drives: 4 (two mirrored pairs).
Pros: Fast (striping) and redundant (mirroring); can lose multiple drives (one per mirror) without failure.
Cons: Expensive (50% capacity overhead); complex setup.
Use: High-performance servers, databases; balances speed and reliability.
