Mobile Device Networks Documentation
Mobile devices rely on various network technologies for connectivity, from cellular networks to wireless options. This guide covers cellular technologies (3G, 4G, 5G), Wi-Fi, hotspots, SIMs, Bluetooth, and GPS. These enable voice, data, and location services, keeping users connected globally.

Cellular Network Technologies
Cellular networks divide coverage areas into "cells" using antennas for voice and data communication.
Overview: Antennas cover cells with different frequencies; users control data/voice via settings (e.g., airplane mode).
3G (1998): Enabled larger data transfers; supported GPS, mobile TV, video conferencing, and data services.
4G (LTE/GSM/EDGE): Up to 150 Mbps; expanded 3G capabilities.
LTE Advanced (LTE-A): Up to 300 Mbps; further increased data throughput.
5G (2020): Up to 10 Gbps (higher frequencies) or 100-900 Mbps; supports IoT with high bandwidth for fast notifications, cloud processing, and large data transfers.

Wi-Fi Networking
High-speed wireless networks for local connectivity.
802.11 Standards: Provide voice, video, data transfer without wires; limited range via access points.
Functionality: Enables voice calls over Wi-Fi if cellular signal is poor; supports various applications.
Usage: Common at home/office; connects multiple devices to a local network.

Hotspot Connectivity
Turn mobile phones into internet routers for multiple devices.
How It Works: Phone connects to cellular (e.g., 5G); other devices connect via Wi-Fi (802.11).
Benefits: Portable internet access anywhere; built into phone OS.
Considerations: Requires carrier enablement; may incur extra charges—check with provider.

SIMs (Subscriber Identity Modules)
Identify devices on cellular networks.
Physical SIM: Card containing carrier/subscriber info (SIM ID, phone number, network details); stores contacts/messages; removable for device swaps.
eSIM (Embedded SIM): Electronic, built-in; software-managed for transfers (e.g., via QR code); supports multiple profiles on one device.
Management: Easier with eSIM; physical SIMs are small and require tools for handling.

Bluetooth
Short-range wireless for device pairing.
Pairing Process: Enable Bluetooth on both devices; make discoverable; confirm PIN for security.
Features: One-time pairing for automatic reconnection; supports headsets, speakers, etc.
Variations: PIN may be fixed or dynamic; check device documentation for specifics.
Testing: Power cycle devices to ensure auto-reconnection.

GPS Satellites
Global positioning for location services.
Technology: US Department of Defense system using orbiting satellites; requires 4+ visible satellites for accuracy.
Function: Determines longitude, latitude, altitude via signal differences.
Alternatives: Wi-Fi networks or cellular triangulation for location if GPS fails.
Usage: Powers maps, location apps; enhances navigation and services.
