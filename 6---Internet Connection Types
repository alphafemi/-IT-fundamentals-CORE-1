⭕ Internet Connection Types

✴️ Satellite Networking
Internet via satellite dish communicating with satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
*️⃣ Speed & Latency
~50 Mbps download, 3 Mbps upload; latency ~250ms (newer systems 20-40ms)
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases
High latency, suitable for rural/remote areas, expensive, e.g., Starlink

✴️ Fiber Optic
High-speed internet using fiber optic cables transmitting data as light signals
*️⃣ Speed & Latency
Very high speeds (up to 1 Gbps+), low latency
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases
Fast, reliable, cost-effective for urban and enterprise use

✴️ Cable Broadband
Internet over coaxial cables (cable TV infrastructure) using DOCSIS standard.
*️⃣ Speed & Latency
Up to 1 Gbps or higher (provider-dependent)
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases
Shared bandwidth, widely available in urban/suburban areas.

✴️ DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
Internet over existing copper telephone lines, typically ADSL (asymmetric)
*️⃣ Speed & Latency.
Up to 200 Mbps download, 20 Mbps upload; limited to ~10,000 ft from exchange.
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases.
Distance-limited, slower upload speeds, common in older infrastructure.

✴️ Cellular Network
Internet via mobile networks (4G, 5G) using phones or dedicated devices
*️⃣ Speed & Latency
Varies widely; 5G offers multi-Gbps speeds, low latency
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases
Mobile, supports tethering/hotspots, growing 5G adoption

✴️ WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider)
Internet delivered wirelessly from ground stations (not satellites) using 802.11, 5G, or proprietary tech
*️⃣ Speed & Latency
Varies; depends on tech and environment
*️⃣ Key Characteristics & Use Cases
Focus on rural/local wireless coverage, requires external antennas

KEY POINT
📛 Satellite: Best for remote areas but suffers from high latency and cost.
📛 Fiber: Fastest, most reliable, ideal for high-demand users.
📛 Cable: High speed but shared bandwidth can cause congestion.
📛 DSL: Limited by distance, slower upload speeds.
📛 Cellular: Mobile, flexible, with 5G promising very high speeds.
📛 WISP: Wireless alternative for rural/local areas without wired infrastructure.
