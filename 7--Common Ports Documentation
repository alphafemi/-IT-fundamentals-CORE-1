Common Ports Documentation
Applications use well-known port numbers for network communication, crucial for troubleshooting, firewall configuration, and understanding protocols. This guide lists key ports for TCP/UDP, explains their protocols, and why they're important. Memorize these for A+ studies; they become intuitive with use.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Ports: TCP 20 (active data), TCP 21 (control/admin).
Purpose: Transfers files between devices; supports authentication (username/password or anonymous).
Features: Lists directories, adds/deletes/renames files; full administration.
Use: Generic file transfers across OSes.

SSH (Secure Shell)
Port: TCP 22.
Purpose: Encrypted command-line access to remote devices.
Comparison: Secure alternative to Telnet; encrypts all data.
Use: Remote administration; preferred over insecure protocols.

Telnet
Port: TCP 23.
Purpose: Unencrypted command-line access (deprecated).
Issues: Data sent in clear text; insecure.
Use: Legacy systems without SSH; avoid in modern networks.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
Port: TCP 25.
Purpose: Sends emails between servers or from devices to servers.
Use: Email transmission; configure on mail servers and clients.

DNS (Domain Name System)
Port: UDP 53.
Purpose: Translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) to IP addresses.
Importance: Essential for browsing; multiple servers for redundancy.
Use: Resolves FQDNs to IPs for network communication.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Ports: UDP 67 (server), UDP 68 (client).
Purpose: Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, DNS servers.
Process: Leases IPs from a pool; can reserve static IPs for devices.
Use: Seamless network configuration; common in routers/servers.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Port: TCP 80.
Purpose: Non-encrypted web communication.
Use: Standard web browsing; increasingly replaced by HTTPS.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Port: TCP 443.
Purpose: Encrypted web communication.
Use: Secure browsing; encrypts data; preferred for modern sites.

POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3)
Port: TCP 110.
Purpose: Downloads emails to local clients.
Limitations: Basic; no multi-client sync.
Use: Email retrieval.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4)
Port: TCP 143.
Purpose: Accesses emails on server; supports folders, multi-client sync.
Advantages: Manages inboxes from multiple devices.
Use: Advanced email access.

SMB (Server Message Block) / CIFS (Common Internet File System)
Ports: TCP 139 (NetBIOS), TCP 445 (direct/NetBIOS-less).
Purpose: File/printer sharing in Windows; transfers data between Windows devices.
Evolution: Older versions used NetBIOS (UDP 137 for name service); modern uses direct TCP 445.
Use: Windows networking, file transfers.

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
Port: TCP 389.
Purpose: Accesses directory services/databases (e.g., user info, resources).
Structure: Organized by OU (organizational unit), CN (common name).
Use: Active Directory; authentication and lookups.

LDAPS (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure)
Port: TCP 636 (or LDAP over SSL).
Purpose: Secure LDAP with encryption.
Use: Protected directory access.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
Port: TCP 3389.
Purpose: Remote control of Windows desktops; view/share screens, run apps.
Compatibility: Windows primary; clients for Mac, Linux, iOS, etc.
Use: Troubleshooting, remote support.
