VLANs and VPNs Documentation
VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) provide network segmentation and secure remote connectivity. This guide explains how VLANs separate broadcast domains for efficiency and security, and how VPNs encrypt data for safe communication. Based on the transcript, it covers VLAN configuration, inter-VLAN routing, and VPN types (client-to-site, site-to-site).

VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
VLANs logically segment a physical network into separate broadcast domains, improving efficiency and security.

LAN Basics: A LAN is a group of devices in one broadcast domain; broadcasts reach all devices in the LAN.
VLAN Concept: Allows multiple broadcast domains on one physical switch by assigning ports to VLANs.
Benefits:
Efficiency: Combines devices from multiple physical switches into one, saving space and power.
Security/Organization: Isolates traffic (e.g., red VLAN devices can't see blue VLAN broadcasts).
Example: Switch with ports assigned to VLAN 1 (gate room), VLAN 2 (dining room), VLAN 3 (infirmary); broadcasts stay within VLANs.
Inter-VLAN Communication: Requires a router (internal switch routing or external) to allow traffic between VLANs.
Configuration: Modern switches support VLANs; assign ports to VLAN IDs.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
VPNs create encrypted tunnels for secure communication over untrusted networks like the internet.
Purpose: Encrypts data to prevent interception; uses a VPN concentrator (hardware/software) for encryption/decryption.
Components: Built into firewalls, appliances, or software; clients connect to concentrators.
Encryption: Protects data in transit; concentrator decrypts for internal access and re-encrypts for outbound.

      Types of VPNs
VPNs vary by connection type for remote access or site linking.

Client-to-Site VPN:

Description: Remote users (clients) connect to a central site (e.g., corporate network) via VPN concentrator.
Use Case: Work-from-home; encrypts traffic from user to concentrator.
Features: Always-on option; automatic connection on login.
Example: User at home accesses corporate resources securely over the internet.

Site-to-Site VPN:

Description: Connects entire sites (e.g., branch offices) via firewalls as concentrators.
Use Case: Link remote offices to headquarters; encrypts inter-site traffic.
Features: Internal traffic is clear; internet-bound data encrypted.
Example: Corporate HQ and remote site communicate securely over the internet.
