Motherboard Compatibility Documentation
Motherboard compatibility depends on CPU type, socket, and intended use (e.g., desktops vs. servers). This guide covers differences between Intel and AMD-based motherboards, CPU installation, and server-specific features. Based on the transcript, Intel and AMD require matching sockets, while servers emphasize scalability for high-performance needs.

Intel vs. AMD Motherboards
Intel and AMD CPUs are compatible but require specific motherboard sockets; choose based on performance, price, and features.

    Intel Motherboards:

Sockets: Vary by generation (e.g., LGA 1200 for 10th/11th gen, LGA 1700 for 12th/13th gen); use land grid array (pins on motherboard).
Performance: Often higher single-threaded performance; premium for gaming/workstations.
Price: Typically higher-end; competes with AMD on value.
Use: Desktops, laptops; integrated features like Thunderbolt.

      AMD Motherboards:

Sockets: AM4 (mainstream, e.g., Ryzen 3000/5000), AM5 (latest Ryzen 7000); pins on CPU.
Performance: Strong multi-threaded; better value for multi-core tasks.
Price: Often more affordable; seen as budget-friendly, but high-end models rival Intel.
Use: Budget builds, content creation; good for overclocking.
Key Differences: Sockets are incompatible (AMD pin grid vs. Intel land grid); motherboards tailored to chipset (e.g., Intel Z690 vs. AMD B550). Performance/price fluctuate; check benchmarks for needs.

Compatibility Notes: Ensure motherboard supports CPU generation; BIOS updates may be needed for new CPUs.

CPU Installation
Installing CPUs is simple but requires care to avoid damage.

Process:
Align CPU with socket (match notches/keys).
Place gently (no force); close retention lever/handle to secure.
Tips: Use thermal paste if not pre-applied; ensure socket is clean; handle by edges.
Compatibility: Motherboard must match CPU socket/type; check manuals.

Server Motherboards
Server motherboards prioritize scalability, reliability, and high capacity for enterprise use.

Features:
Multi-Socket: Support 2+ CPUs (e.g., dual Xeon or EPYC) for parallel processing.
Memory: 4-16+ slots (ECC RAM for error correction); high capacity (e.g., 1TB+).
Expansion Slots: Multiple PCIe for NICs, storage controllers, GPUs.
Form Factor: Full ATX for 19-inch racks; redundant power/fans for uptime.
Pros: Handles heavy workloads (databases, virtualization); ECC memory prevents data corruption.
Cons: Expensive; requires server-grade components.
Use: Data centers, enterprise servers; not for desktops.
