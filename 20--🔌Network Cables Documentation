Network Cables Documentation
Network cables form the backbone of wired connectivity, enabling high-speed data transfer for Ethernet networks. This guide covers twisted pair cables, categories, coaxial, unshielded vs. shielded types, direct burial STP, and plenum-rated cables. Based on the transcript, it explains construction, interference mitigation, standards, and applications for reliable installations.

Twisted Pair Cables
Twisted pair is the most common copper cable for Ethernet, with wires twisted to reduce interference.

Construction: Four pairs of wires (blue, green, orange, brown); each pair twisted at different rates to cancel noise.
How It Works: Signals on pairs (e.g., Transmit+ and Transmit-) counteract interference; receiver distinguishes signal from noise.
Use: Wired Ethernet; foundation for LANs; supports various speeds based on category.

Cable Categories and Standards
Categories define cable performance; minimum category required for Ethernet standards per IEEE 802.3.
Cat 5: Deprecated; supports 1000BASE-T (1Gbps) up to 100m.
Cat 5e (Enhanced): Improved testing; supports 1000BASE-T up to 100m; common for new installs.
Cat 6: Supports 10GBASE-T (10Gbps) up to 55m (unshielded) or 100m (shielded).
Cat 6A (Augmented): Supports 10GBASE-T up to 100m.
Note: Cable speed depends on signaling, not the cable itself; always check IEEE standards for compatibility.

Coaxial Cable
Coaxial (coax) uses a central conductor with outer shield for high-frequency signals.
Construction: Inner conductor for signal; outer shield for protection.
Use: Cable modems/digital cable; high-speed internet over cable infrastructure.
Not Primary for Ethernet: Less common than twisted pair for LANs.

Unshielded vs. Shielded Twisted Pair (UTP vs. STP)

Shielding protects against electromagnetic interference (EMI); choice depends on environment.
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): No shielding; cost-effective; suitable for low-interference areas.
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Shielding around pairs or entire cable; better for high-EMI environments (e.g., industrial).
Abbreviations:
U/UTP: Unshielded overall, unshielded pairs.
S/FTP: Braided shield overall, foil on pairs.
F/UTP: Foil shield overall, unshielded pairs.
Example: Cat 7 S/FTP has braided outer shield and foil on each pair.
Use: STP for interference-prone areas; UTP for standard office/home.

Direct Burial STP Cable
Specialized STP for underground installations between buildings.
Construction: Shielded pairs; waterproof gel; drain wire for grounding/strength.
Features: Waterproof; no conduit needed; buried directly in ground.
Use: Campus networks; protects against moisture/interference; easier than overhead runs.

Plenum-Rated Cable
Fire-resistant cables for spaces above drop ceilings (plenum areas).
Context: Plenum space allows air circulation; fire/smoke can spread easily.
Construction: Jacket of FEP (Fluorinated Ethylene Polymer) or low-smoke PVC; less flexible than standard PVC.
Use: Commercial buildings; above drop ceilings; meets fire safety codes; functionally identical to standard cable but safer.
Importance: Prevents fire/smoke spread; required in plenum environments.
