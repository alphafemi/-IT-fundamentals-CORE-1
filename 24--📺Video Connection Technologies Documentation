Video Connection Technologies Documentation
Monitors and displays connect to computers via various interfaces for video (and sometimes audio) transmission. This guide covers HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA, and video over USB-C, including their specs, connectors, and uses. Based on the transcript, it explains digital vs. analog, compatibility, and modern trends.

Overview
Video connections have evolved from analog (VGA) to digital (HDMI, DisplayPort), supporting higher resolutions and audio. Choose based on device compatibility, resolution needs, and cable length. USB-C enables versatile, multi-signal connections.

HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface)
HDMI is a common digital interface for audio and video in consumer electronics.

Specs: Digital; supports audio/video; max 20m range; resolutions up to 4K/8K.
Connector: 19-pin Type A; rectangular with indented corners; prevents misinsertion.
Features: Sends uncompressed audio/video; backward compatible with some standards.
Use: Monitors, TVs, gaming; common on modern devices.

DisplayPort
DisplayPort is a digital interface for high-performance video, similar to HDMI but packetized.

Specs: Digital; supports audio/video; resolutions up to 8K; max range varies (up to 15m with active cables).
Connector: Rectangular with slanted corner; locking mechanism (press button to release); mini DisplayPort for smaller devices.
Features: Compatible with HDMI/DVI via passive adapters; packetized like Ethernet.
Use: PCs, high-end monitors; supports daisy-chaining and multi-monitor setups.

DVI (Digital Visual Interface)
DVI is a digital (and sometimes analog) interface, common on older systems.

Specs: Digital (DVI-D) or analog (DVI-A); video-only (no audio); single-link: 3.7 Gbps (1920x1200); dual-link: higher bandwidth.
Connectors:
DVI-A: Analog; compatible with VGA.
DVI-D: Digital; single/dual-link.
DVI-I: Integrated (analog + digital).
Features: Backwards-compatible with VGA; no audio.
Use: Older monitors/graphics cards; transitioning to HDMI/DisplayPort.

VGA (Video Graphics Array)
VGA is a legacy analog interface for video-only transmission.

Specs: Analog; video-only; max 5m range; resolutions up to 2048x1536 (limited by signal degradation).
Connector: DE-15 (DB-15); 15-pin D-shaped; often blue.
Features: Standardized colors per PC guidelines; no audio.
Use: Legacy equipment; replaced by digital interfaces for better quality.

Video over USB-C
USB-C enables versatile video transmission alongside other signals.

Specs: Depends on protocol (e.g., DisplayPort over USB-C: up to 8K; HDMI: 4K); supports video, audio, power, data.
Connector: Reversible USB-C; signals include USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, HDMI, MHL.
Features: Multi-purpose; one cable for video, power, and data; adapters for specific protocols.
Use: Modern laptops/phones; universal for docking stations and peripherals.
