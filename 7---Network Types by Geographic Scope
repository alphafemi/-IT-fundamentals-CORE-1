⭕ Network Types by Geographic Scope

✴️ Local Area Network (LAN)
Covers small geographic area (building or campus) using high-bandwidth tech like Ethernet or Wi-Fi (802.11)
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi access points; office/home networks

✴️ Wide Area Network (WAN)
Connects devices across cities, countries, or globally; often slower due to distance
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
MPLS, point-to-point serial links, fiber, satellite links; corporate/global networks

✴️ Personal Area Network (PAN)
Short-range network for personal devices (phones, earbuds, car audio) using Bluetooth, infrared, NFC
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
Bluetooth, NFC; device-to-device communication

✴️ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Connects multiple sites within a city or region, bridging LAN and WAN scales
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
Metro Ethernet, fiber; government or large enterprise networks

✴️ Storage Area Network (SAN)
High-speed network dedicated to centralized storage with block-level access. 
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
Fibre Channel, iSCSI; data centers, enterprise storage

✴️ Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
LAN using 802.11 wireless tech, typically within buildings; range extended by access points
*️⃣ Typical Technologies & Use Cases
Wi-Fi networks in offices, homes, public spaces

KEY POINT
📛 LAN: Small area, high speed, wired or wireless.
📛 WAN: Large area, slower, connects multiple LANs.
📛 PAN: Very short range, personal devices.
📛 MAN: City-wide, bridges LAN and WAN.
📛 SAN: Specialized for storage with high bandwidth.
📛 WLAN: Wireless LAN, common in buildings.
