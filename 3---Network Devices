✴️ Key Network Devices: What They Do & Where They Fit
Each device operates at specific OSI layers, handling different aspects of data transmission:

❇️ Router (OSI Layer 3 - Network Layer)
Features: Connects diverse network types (e.g., WLAN, LAN, copper, fiber) and topologies. It's the "traffic director" routing packets between networks using IP addresses.

❇️ Switch (OSI Layer 2 - Data Link Layer)
Features: Links devices within the same network (e.g., computers and servers in an office) using MAC addresses for efficient, collision-free communication.

#️⃣ Types:
⭕Unmanaged Switch: Plug-and-play basics—no config needed for simple setups.
⭕ Managed Switch: Advanced control for VLANs, QoS, and monitoring—ideal for enterprise security segmentation.
Cybersecurity Angle: Use managed switches to isolate sensitive traffic and detect anomalies.

❇️ Wireless Access Point (WAP) (OSI Layer 2 - Data Link Layer)
Features: Bridges wireless devices (like phones/laptops) to a wired network, acting like a "Wi-Fi switch" for seamless connectivity.

❇️ Firewall
Features: Enforces security policies by filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and rules—blocks unauthorized access.
#️⃣ Layers:
⭕ Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Traditional firewalls inspect ports/protocols (e.g., blocking TCP 23 for Telnet).
⭕ Layer 7 (Application Layer): Next-gen firewalls deep-inspect app traffic (e.g., scanning HTTP for malware).

❇️ Hub (OSI Layer 1 - Physical Layer)
Features: A basic multi-port repeater that broadcasts all incoming traffic to every connected device—simple but outdated.
Drawbacks: Inefficient (causes network congestion) and insecure (everyone sees all data).

✴️ The OSI Model: Layered Blueprint for Networking
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a 7-layer framework for how data moves. Here's a quick map with device examples (focusing on the most relevant layers for hardware):

✳️ Layer 1 (Physical): Bits over cables/wireless—Hubs, cables, NICs (Network Interface Cards).
✳️ Layer 2 (Data Link): MAC addressing and error detection—Switches, Wireless Access Points.
✳️ Layer 3 (Network): IP routing across networks—Routers, Layer 3 Switches.
✳️ Layer 4 (Transport): End-to-end delivery (TCP/UDP)—Traditional Firewalls.
✳️ Layer 7 (Application): User-facing protocols (HTTP, FTP)—Advanced Firewalls with app-layer inspection.
