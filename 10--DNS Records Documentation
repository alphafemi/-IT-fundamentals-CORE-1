DNS Records Documentation
DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical service that translates fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) like www.professormesser.com into IP addresses. This guide covers key DNS records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, DKIM, SPF, and DMARC. These records store information in a distributed, hierarchical database, enabling global name resolution. Based on the transcript, it explains record types, configurations, and uses for web, email, and security.

DNS Overview
DNS resolves names to IPs, allowing easy access without memorizing addresses.

Hierarchy: Root servers (13 clusters, ~1,000 servers) → Top-Level Domains (TLDs like .com, .org, country codes like .us) → Domains (e.g., professormesser.com) → Subdomains/Hosts.
Distributed Database: Scattered globally; managed by ISPs, organizations, or providers.
Tools:
dig: Queries DNS servers (e.g., dig www.professormesser.com returns IPs).
nslookup: Similar on Windows (e.g., nslookup professormesser.com).
Resource Records (RR): Entries in DNS databases; changes require backups to avoid outages.

    A Record (Address Record)
Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.

Purpose: Resolves FQDNs to IPv4 IPs for devices.
Example: www.professormesser.com → 162.159.246.164.
Configuration: Hostname (e.g., www), IP address, TTL (Time to Live, e.g., 15 minutes for cache expiration).
Use: Primary for IPv4 web servers; multiple A records enable redundancy (e.g., load balancing).

    AAAA Record (Quad A Record)
Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.

Purpose: Resolves FQDNs to IPv6 IPs.
Example: Similar to A record but for longer IPv6 addresses.
Configuration: Hostname, IPv6 address, TTL.
Use: Essential for IPv6 networks; supports modern addressing.

      CNAME Record (Canonical Name)
Creates an alias for another hostname.

Purpose: Points one name to another (e.g., aliases for a single server).
Example: chat.example.com, ftp.example.com, www.example.com all point to mail.example.com.
Configuration: Alias name, target canonical name.
Use: Simplifies management; change the target A/AAAA record, and aliases update automatically.

      MX Record (Mail Exchanger)
Specifies mail servers for email routing.

Purpose: Directs emails to the correct mail server.
Example: professormesser.com MX → mail.professormesser.com → IP via A record.
Configuration: Hostname (e.g., @ or blank for domain), target mail server, priority (lower number = higher priority), TTL.
Use: Enables sending/receiving emails; multiple MX for redundancy.

      TXT Record (Text Record)
Stores human-readable text for verification or policies.

Purpose: Holds arbitrary text; used for domain verification, spam prevention.
Examples: Stripe verification, SPF, DKIM, DMARC.
Configuration: Hostname, text content, TTL.
Viewing: Use dig (e.g., dig professormesser.com TXT) or nslookup (e.g., nslookup -type=txt google.com).
Use: Verifies ownership; supports email security.

      DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
Provides digital signatures for email authenticity.

Purpose: Verifies emails originated from the domain using public/private key pairs.
How It Works: Email server signs outgoing emails with private key; recipients check public key in DNS TXT record.
Configuration: TXT record with v=DKIM1 and public key; hostname often provided by email server.
Use: Prevents spoofing; ensures emails are from legitimate senders.

      SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
Lists authorized email servers for a domain.

Purpose: Prevents spoofing by specifying valid outgoing servers.
How It Works: Recipients check if the sending server is in the SPF TXT record.
Configuration: TXT record with hostname (@) and list of servers (e.g., include:_spf.google.com).
Use: Reduces spam; validates senders for domains using multiple servers.

    DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
Sets policies for handling failed email validations.

Purpose: Defines actions for emails failing SPF/DKIM (e.g., quarantine, reject).
How It Works: TXT record specifies policy (none, quarantine, reject) and reporting email.
Configuration: TXT record with v=DMARC1, policy (p=quarantine), and rua=mailto:report@example.com.
Use: Enhances email security; provides reports on dispositions.
