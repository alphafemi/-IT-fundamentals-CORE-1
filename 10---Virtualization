🖥️ Virtualization: Running Worlds Within Worlds! 🌐
Virtualization is a technology that allows you to run multiple, isolated operating systems (called Virtual Machines or VMs) simultaneously on a single physical computer.
Virtualization is managed by a hypervisor. It's the backbone of cloud efficiency and modern IT.
🔄 Core Concept: Multiple 'guest' operating systems on a single host, each with virtual CPU, memory, network, and storage.
🏠 Types:
✴️ Virtual Machine (VM): A software-based emulation of a physical computer, with its own virtual CPU, memory, network interface, and storage.

✴️ Host-Based Virtualization: Primary OS (host) runs a program (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) for guests. Ideal for desktops/laptops.

🖥️ Hypervisor:
Software that abstracts the physical hardware and allocates resources (CPU, memory, network) to VMs.
✳️ Type 1 (Bare-Metal): Direct on hardware (e.g., ESXi, Hyper-V)—efficient for data centers.
✳️ Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on host OS (e.g., Workstation, Parallels)—common for personal use.

🧠 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI/DaaS):
 Also called Desktop as a Service (DaaS), this technology allows a complete desktop environment to run as a virtual machine on a remote server (often in the cloud).
❗ The user interacts with the desktop via the network.
❗ The local device only needs a keyboard, mouse, and display

📦 Containerization (Application Virtualization)
Containerization is a lighter-weight alternative to VMs, virtualizing at the application level instead of the hardware level.
❗ All containers share a single host operating system and kernel.
❗ Each container runs an isolated application, with its own environment and libraries.
