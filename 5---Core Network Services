⭕ ⭕ Core Network Services: Functions & Security Essentials
These services automate, manage, and protect data flow. Deploy them thoughtfully with firewalls and monitoring for best results:

✴️ DNS Server (Domain Name System)
Purpose: Translates human-readable domains (e.g., example.com) to IP addresses, enabling seamless web navigation.

✴️ DHCP Server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Purpose: Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnets, and configs to devices joining a network, simplifying management.

✴️ File Server
Purpose: Centralized storage and sharing of files across a network (e.g., via SMB/NFS protocols) for teams to access documents.

✴️ Print Server
Purpose: Manages print jobs from multiple devices to shared printers, queuing and distributing tasks efficiently.

✴️ Mail Server
Purpose: Handles sending, receiving, and storing emails (e.g., using SMTP/IMAP/POP3) for organizational communication.

✴️ Syslog Server
Purpose: Collects and logs system events, errors, and activities from network devices for centralized monitoring and auditing.

✴️ Web Server
Purpose: Hosts and delivers websites/web apps (e.g., via HTTP/HTTPS on Apache/Nginx), serving content to browsers.

✴️ Authentication Server
Purpose: Verifies user identities (e.g., via RADIUS, LDAP, or Kerberos) for secure access to resources like VPNs or apps.

✴️ Mail Gateway (Spam Filtering)
Purpose: Acts as an email filter between external sources and your mail server, scanning for spam, viruses, and threats.

✴️ Unified Threat Management (UTM) / Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Purpose: All-in-one security appliance combining firewall, IDS/IPS, antivirus, and VPN for comprehensive traffic inspection.

✴️ Load Balancer
Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability, scalability, and no single point of failure.

✴️ Proxy Server
Purpose: Intermediary for client requests (e.g., web caching, anonymity), filtering and forwarding traffic to destinations.
