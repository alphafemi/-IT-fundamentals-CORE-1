Network Devices Documentation
Data centers and networks rely on various devices to manage traffic, security, and connectivity. This guide covers key network devices: routers, switches (unmanaged/managed), access points, patch panels, firewalls, Power over Ethernet (PoE), cable/DSL modems, ONTs, and NICs. Based on the transcript, it explains their functions, types, and roles in building networks.


    Routers
Routers forward traffic between IP subnets based on destination IP addresses.
Function: Use routing tables to decide packet paths; operate at OSI Layer 3.
Features: Connect different network types (e.g., Ethernet to wireless, fiber to copper).
Types: Standalone or combined with switches (Layer 3 switches); used for inter-VLAN routing.
Use: Essential for subnet communication; often include security features.


        Switches
Switches connect devices within a LAN, forwarding based on MAC addresses.
Function: Hardware-based (ASIC) for high speed; support multiple ports (e.g., 24/48 for workgroups, hundreds for cores).
Features: May include PoE, routing (multilayer switches), VLANs, redundancy, port mirroring.
--Types:
Unmanaged Switches: Plug-and-play; no configuration; single VLAN; low cost; no SNMP/logging.
Managed Switches: Configurable; support VLANs, traffic prioritization, redundancy, remote management (SNMP); for enterprises.
      

    Access Points
Access points bridge wired and wireless networks.
Function: Switch between Ethernet (wired) and Wi-Fi (wireless); forward based on MAC addresses (bridged, not routed).
Use: Enable wireless connectivity; no IP translation.
Difference from Routers: Not for routing; pure bridging.

      Patch Panels
Patch panels organize and manage Ethernet cables in wiring closets.
Function: Terminate cables from desks (punch-down blocks); provide RJ45 ports for flexible connections to switches/VLANs.
Benefits: Simplify cable management; change connections without rewiring runs.
Setup: Permanent desk-to-closet cables; short patch cables for closet reconfiguration.
      
      Firewalls
Firewalls control traffic based on rules for security.
Function: Allow/block traffic by port (traditional) or application (next-gen).
Features: VPN concentrator, proxy server, routing; protect against threats.
Types: Hardware/software; integrated into routers for multi-interface management.
Power over Ethernet (PoE)
PoE delivers power and data over Ethernet cables.

Function: Power devices (e.g., phones, access points, cameras) via Ethernet; simplifies installations.
Standards:
PoE: 15.4W, 350mA (basic devices).
PoE+: 25.5W, 600mA (larger devices like PTZ cameras).
PoE++: 51W/71.3W, 600/960mA (laptops, 10G Ethernet).
Implementation: Endspan (switch-integrated) or midspan (injector); downward compatible but not upward.
Benefits: Single cable for data/power; reduces wiring complexity.
      

    Cable and DSL Modems
Modems connect to broadband internet via cable or phone lines.
Cable Modems: Use coax (DOCSIS standard); provide Ethernet; high speeds (1G+); common for cable TV users.
DSL Modems: Use phone lines; speeds up to 200Mbps down/20Mbps up; limited by distance (10,000 ft from central office).
Use: Convert broadband signals to Ethernet for routers.

      ONTs (Optical Network Terminals)
ONTs convert fiber optic signals to copper for home/business use.
Function: Demarcation point; fiber in, copper/Ethernet out; ISP responsibility outside, user inside.
Features: RJ45 (data), RJ11 (VoIP), F-connector (video/coax).
Use: For fiber internet; installed at building entry.

      NICs (Network Interface Cards)
NICs enable devices to connect to Ethernet networks.
Function: Provide Ethernet interfaces; each has a unique MAC address.
Types: Integrated (on motherboards) or expansion cards (e.g., 100M, 1G, fiber); multiple ports possible.
Use: Connect servers/laptops to networks; ensure compatibility with network speed/type.
